# <img src="https://github.com/doodlezucc/YouTube-Music-Account-Switch/raw/master/icon.png" width="20px"/> YouTube Music Account Switch

A browser extension that automatically switches Google accounts when visiting [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com) and [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com).

### Currently not working!

**Apparently, they changed YouTube Music to a point where the accounts are no longer found in the HTML itself.**

On installation, you get to choose which account should be used on each site. You may also change this at any time by clicking the extension icon.

YTMAS fully relies on how YouTube structures their websites.
I didn't find any API and therefore decided to simply simulate mouse clicks on certain elements.
This also means that the extension will probably stop working (until adaption) whenever there's a new design update from YouTube.

The icon includes Font Awesome's [user-circle](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-circle?style=solid)
